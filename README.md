## Project Overview
This project benchmarks the following searching algorithms:

### Searching Algorithms:
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**
- **Interpolation Search**
- **Jump Search**
- **Hash-Based Search**
- **Exponential Search**
- **Ternary Search**
- **Parallel Linear Search**
- **Parallel Binary Search**
- **Parallel Hash-Based Search**
- **Parallel Jump Search**

The benchmarks are run on a sorted array of 1,000,000 elements to compare the performance of each algorithm. The project uses BenchmarkDotNet to measure execution time and memory allocation.

## Algorithms Benchmarked
### 1. Linear Search
- **Description**: Iterates through each element in the array until the target is found.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Use Case**: Suitable for small or unsorted datasets.

### 2. Binary Search
- **Description**: Efficiently searches a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Use Case**: Ideal for large, sorted datasets.

### 3. Interpolation Search
- **Description**: Improved version of Binary Search for uniformly distributed datasets. Estimates the position of the target.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log log n) on average, O(n) in the worst case.
- **Use Case**: Best for large, uniformly distributed, sorted datasets.

### 4. Jump Search
- **Description**: Searches a sorted array by jumping ahead in fixed steps and then performing a linear search within the block.
- **Time Complexity**: O(\sqrt{n})
- **Use Case**: Suitable for large, sorted datasets.

### 5. Hash-Based Search
- **Description**: Uses a hash table (e.g., HashSet) to store and retrieve elements in constant time.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) on average for lookups.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for fast lookups in large datasets.

### 6. Exponential Search
- **Description**: Combines Binary Search and Linear Search. It starts with a small range and exponentially increases it until the target is within the range.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Use Case**: Ideal for unbounded or large sorted datasets.

### 7. Ternary Search
- **Description**: Similar to Binary Search but divides the array into three parts instead of two.
- **Time Complexity**: O(logâ‚ƒ n)
- **Use Case**: Suitable for large, sorted datasets.

### 8. Parallel Linear Search
- **Description**: Parallelized version of Linear Search that divides the array into chunks and searches each chunk in parallel.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n/p), where p is the number of processors.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for large datasets and multi-core processors.

### 9. Parallel Binary Search
- **Description**: Parallelized version of Binary Search that divides the array into sub-arrays and searches each sub-array in parallel.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Use Case**: Suitable for large, sorted datasets and multi-core processors.

### 10. Parallel Hash-Based Search
- **Description**: Parallelized version of Hash-Based Search that divides the keys into chunks and searches each chunk in parallel.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) on average for lookups.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for fast lookups in large datasets and multi-core processors.

### 11. Parallel Jump Search
- **Description**: Parallelized version of Jump Search that divides the array into blocks and searches each block in parallel.
- **Time Complexity**: O(\sqrt{n}/p), where p is the number of processors.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for large, sorted datasets and multi-core processors.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK (version 6.0 or later)
- BenchmarkDotNet (included in the project)

### Steps
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-searching-benchmark.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd sorting-searching-benchmark
```

Restore the dependencies:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

## Running the Benchmarks
To run the benchmarks, use the following command:
```bash
dotnet run -c Release
```
This will execute the benchmarks in Release mode (required for accurate benchmarking) and display the results in the console.

## Results
The benchmarks will output detailed performance metrics, including:
- **Mean time**: The average time taken to perform the search.
- **Allocated memory**: The amount of memory allocated during the search.
- **Standard deviation**: The variation in execution times.
